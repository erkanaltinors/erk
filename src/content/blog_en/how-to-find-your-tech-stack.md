Choosing tools for a new project is so crucial. 

You have to think twice (or more) before start. Project's life is depends to these tools.
You have to clarify the goals of the project before choosing tools you will use. Some customers know what they want but mostly they don't. You can ask questions to know customer's want.

## SEO: How important?

Most of the customer wants their website ranked at the top but it is not easy. Rarely, they want internal projects to use in only for company needs and doesn't want to go for public. Importance of SEO will define the rendering strategy for the project.

## Rendering: Static, Server-Side or Client-Side

Each rendering strategy has its own pros and cons. Choose rendering strategy due to project's needs.

You can choose static rendering for the pages which will not update regularly and has crucial information for SEO. Contact and About Us pages can be example for static pages. Remember that prerendered pages can only be generated in build session.

You can choose server side rendering when you want to show current information and keep SEO friendly page. Rendering performance is depends to server capability, requests and server responses. Keep your data as low as possible to decreace rendering time.

You can choose client side rendering when you want to show current data regularly and periodically while you don't need SEO. Client side rendering heavily relies on visitor's device so that the page can show quickly due to contents you fetch. Keep your requests as low as possible to decrease rendering time. Make sure your page is ready to interaction as soon as possible.

## Hosting

Hosting options gives you several pros and cons. Each option brings their own dependencies.

Cloud hosting gives you ready-to-go options to decrease your "time to market".
You can bring your own hosting so that you can manage everything in your hosting environment - you can even host a website using raspberry pi. You have to manage your server's health and monitor regularly for the future needs of project.

## Frameworks

Frontend or Backend. Doesn't matter. You will probably use one of the known frameworks like React, PHP, NodeJS etc. Choosing framework and library is most important part of the tech stack - espacially the meta framework. Building a web project using a meta framework gives you developer experience a lot. Choose wisely. You can choose Nextjs if you will need developer community and SPA but you will stick with React for that. You can choose Astro if you don't know how to handle SPA's quirks and you may need ui frameworks other than React.

## Libraries

You will probably need libraries. A lot. And it is ok. We all use them. Libraries are mostly has dependency to your framework like React, Vue etc. That shrinks the number of libraries you can use if you are totally dependant to your frontend framework. You can find more libraries if you pick React. Github repository page of the library you seek shows important informations about the library like when last version is released, issue numbers and issue replies.
